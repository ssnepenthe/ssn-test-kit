# ssn-test-kit
Utilities for working with BrowserKit and WP-CLI within my PHPUnit tests.

This repo is just one big experiment... It is designed to meet my needs/wants on the testing front.

You probably don't want to use this.

Instead, look to more established testing tools like:

* Plain ol' PHPUnit + WordPress Unit Test Suite
* Codeception + WP-Browser
* Behat + WordHat
* Etc.
